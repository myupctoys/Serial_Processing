# Serial_Processing
Collection of classes for run time configuring of comm ports in Processing with use case example.

Read "Processing Serial Port routines.docx" for useage. <BR>Tested to work with Processing 3_5_3 and 4_0B8 on W10 64bit. Some attempt started for Linux (Comm port name differences and detecting Windows/Linux)<BR> Note with 3_5_3 one needs to import the Console Library for application to work. In 4_0B8 looks in the code folder for the applicaiton and that works without having to add the Console library.<BR>Additional note 3_5_3 uses Java, 4_0B8 uses OpenJDK. Graphics look a bit messier with OpenJDK.
