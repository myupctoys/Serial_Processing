# Serial_Processing
Collection of classes for run time configuring of comm ports in Processing with use case example.

Read "Processing Serial Port routines.docx" for usage. <BR>Tested to work with Processing 3_5_3 and 4_0B8 on W10 64bit. Some attempt started for Linux (Comm port name differences and detecting Windows/Linux)<BR><BR> Requires G4P and Console libraries accessible from Processing IDE Sketch>>Import Library>>Manage Libraries.<BR>
Note 4_08B has a message on the console __MOVE__ X and Y position of the launch window. This is not something I am activly doing in code, either a bug in the beta or an option I need to turn off. Has no impact on the program or the generated log files.
